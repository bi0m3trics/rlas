This release tries to fix g++-12 issues. I was not able to reproduce because gcc-12 is not widely available yet. I tried to compile it myself, it took me half a day and was not working. I tested on the on rhub platform that uses gcc-12 but was not able to reproduce either. I fixed it the same way I fixed similar warnings in the past so it should do the job.
